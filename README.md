# Project Documentation: Product Store App

## Introduction  
The Product Store App is a Kotlin-based Android application that fetches and displays a list of products from an API. It is built using the MVVM architecture and integrates Hilt for dependency injection, Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous programming, and Retrofit for networking. Offline feature is also implemented.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
cd your-repo-folder
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Project in Android Studio**  
1. Open **Android Studio**  
2. Click on **File ‚Üí Open Project**  
3. Select the cloned repository folder  
4. Let **Gradle sync**  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the App on an Emulator or Physical Device**

## üîé Trade-offs & Improvements

### Trade-offs Made
1. **Limited UI Enhancements** ‚Äì Focused on functionality rather than animations.  
2. **Limited Testing Coverage** ‚Äì While **ViewModel and Repository logic** were tested, UI tests were skipped due to time constraints.  

###  What Would I Do Differently with More Time?
1. **Improve UI with Animations & Loaders**  
   - Add **Shimmer Effect** to improve loading experience.  

2. **Increase Test Coverage**  
   - Add **UI tests using Espresso**.  
   - Use **MockWebServer** for API response testing.  

3. **Optimize API Calls**  
   - Implement **pagination** instead of fetching all products at once.

## Conclusion  
This project successfully implements a **Product Store app** using **modern Android development practices**. While some trade-offs were made, future improvements can make it **more robust, user-friendly, and performant**.
